\arguments{
\item{marg.beta.hat}{Marginal regression coeffcients, inner product of G_o and y divided by the number of observations in original study}

\item{x.r}{Reference panel}

\item{n.o}{The number of observations in original study}

\item{sigma.method}{String indicating how to estimate sigma, currently supports three methods, 'conservative', sigma is estimated as 1.
'estimate' the usual estimator of the variance (assuming y is scaled sigma = 1 - var(x.r beta_mc)), and 'semi.conservative' which is similar to
the 'estimate' method, but the beta_mc is thresholded.}

\item{method.filter}{multiple adjustment method to use in thresholding of the coefficient (see p.adjust)}

\item{method.test}{multiple adjustment method  to use when testing the adjusted coefficients (see p.adjust)}

\item{qu}{P-value threshold.}

\item{explained.omega.beta}{Minimal weight for thresholding omega.beta}

\item{max.omega.beta}{Maximum number of cofficients taken from omega.beta}

\item{is.scaled}{Boolean flag, is original study X and y are scaled. For now only supports TRUE.}
}
\value{
list containing `test.correct` data.frame with the adjusted coefficeint and adjusted variance, with two sided testing p-value
`test.naive` data.frame with the adjusted coefficeint but not adjusted variance, with two sided testing p-value,
 `add.var` the additional variance, `sigma` the estimated sigma, and
 `var.omega.beta` a vector with the number of coefficient used and the proportion of weight used.
